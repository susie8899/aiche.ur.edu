                <li><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/reu-research-experiences-undergraduates" target="_blank">Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)</a> is an opportunity to do research at a college or university often throughout the summer. Many are funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and allow students to explore labs beyond those at the University of Rochesterâ€™s Chemical Engineering Department.</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/che/undergraduate/research.html" target="_blank">Eisenberg Summer Research Fellowship</a> provides funding for research advancements in the Chemical Engineering Department. Chemical Engineering Students in their sophomore and junior years can apply to work in the projects included that year.</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/ugresearch/funding/discover-grant/index.html" target="_blank">Schwartz Discover Grant</a> is another opportunity for students to receive funding to work on a project over the summer. Unlike the Eisenberg Fellowship, its application is open to students not only in Chemical Engineering, but also in the School of Arts & Sciences and the Hajim School of Engineering. </li>
                <li>If you have any further question regarding research applications, fellowships, and research grants, the <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/ugresearch/index.html" target="_blank">Office of Undergraduates Research</a> will be a great resource.</li>
